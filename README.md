# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

## Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
### An accuracy score for the model is calculated (7.5 pt)
### A confusion matrix has been generated (7.5 pt)
### An imbalanced classification report has been generated (15 pt)

## Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

## Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

## Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
