# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

## Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
### An accuracy score for the model is calculated (7.5 pt)
### A confusion matrix has been generated (7.5 pt)
### An imbalanced classification report has been generated (15 pt)

## Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
### SMOTEENN 
#### An accuracy score for the model is calculated (5 pt)
#### A confusion matrix has been generated (5 pt)
#### An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)

## Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
### BalancedRandomForestClassifier
#### An accuracy score for the model is calculated (2.5 pt)

#### A confusion matrix has been generated (2.5 pt)

#### An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)

#### The features are sorted in descending order by feature importance (5 pt)

### EasyEnsembleClassifier
#### An accuracy score of the model is calculated (2.5 pt)

#### A confusion matrix has been generated (2.5 pt)

#### An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)

## Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
### Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to use Python to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict credit risk.  After review and testing, make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Results
- Describe the balanced accuracy scores
- The precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models
- Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results

### Summary
- Summarize the results of the machine learning models
- Recommendation on the model to use
- If you do not recommend any of the models, justify reasoning.
